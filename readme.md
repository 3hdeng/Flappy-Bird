# Building Flappy Bird with Blazor

A Blazor WebAssembly implementation of Flappy Bird!

### About

This project contains the code associated with my tutorial series, which exists both in written format on [my website](https://erinnmclaughlin.com) and in video format on [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy4M_NlMdP7a2TK2PNQioXQ).

Each "part" of the tutorial series will be paired with a branch in this repository. The master branch will contain the code for the most recent update.

### Special Thanks
This project is based on the [vanilla JavaScript project](https://github.com/kubowania/flappy-bird) created by [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania). Thanks! :)
