## About

This project contains the code associated with the "Building Flappy Bird with Blazor" tutorial series, which currently exists in written form on [my website](https://erinnmclaughlin.com/2020/08/10/game-development-with-blazor-part-one/), and will also exist in video form on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy4M_NlMdP7a2TK2PNQioXQ) after the series is complete (complete *enough*, at least). Each "part" of this tutorial will be paired with a branch in this repository. The master branch will contain the code for the most recent update.

## Special Thanks
This project is based on the [vanilla JavaScript project](https://github.com/kubowania/flappy-bird) created by [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania). Thanks! :)
